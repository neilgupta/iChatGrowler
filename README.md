This is a backup of an old AppleScript file I made to add support for Growl in iChat in **Mac OS X 10.5**.
I have not used it since then myself, and have no idea if it still works in later versions, but if you're still running Leopard and want Growl support, here you go.

Installation instructions can be found in index.html or at [metamorphium.com/downloads/ichatgrowler](http://metamorphium.com/downloads/ichatgrowler/).
